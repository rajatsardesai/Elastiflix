# Elastic Stack in One Shot — Elasticsearch, Logstash, Beats & Kibana

This is a fork of [`elastic/Elastiflix`](https://github.com/elastic/Elastiflix), Elastic's
Netflix-style movie search demo, extended so it teaches the **whole** Elastic Stack rather than
just Elasticsearch.

Upstream Elastiflix ships a React frontend, an Express backend and a Python data loader — and
expects you to bring your own Elastic Cloud cluster. This fork adds the missing pieces so you can
run everything locally and see all four components doing real work on one application:

| Component | What it does here |
|---|---|
| **Elasticsearch** | Stores and searches 6,959 movies |
| **Logstash** | Loads the movie catalog, and parses the app's logs |
| **Beats** | Filebeat ships app logs, Metricbeat ships container metrics |
| **Kibana** | Explore the data and build the dashboard |

The nice symmetry: **Elastiflix is both the app *using* Elasticsearch and the app *monitored by*
Elasticsearch.**

## Quick start

Requirements: Docker Desktop with **at least 8 GB** allocated (Settings → Resources → Memory;
12 GB is comfortable), and Python 3.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajatsardesai/Elastiflix.git
cd Elastiflix

./start.sh
```

That's it. There's no step 2.

| | |
|---|---|
| `./start.sh` | Prepares the catalogue, starts all seven containers, waits, prints the URLs |
| `./stop.sh` | Stops everything, keeps your data |
| `./uninstall.sh` | Removes everything including volumes |
| `./load-dashboards.sh` | Reloads the three prebuilt Kibana dashboards (`./start.sh` already does this) |
| `./generate-traffic.sh` | Fires 54 realistic searches (18 queries × 3 rounds, including deliberate zero-result ones) so the Kibana dashboard isn't empty |

`start.sh` also creates the three Kibana data views and loads three prebuilt
dashboards — Search Overview, Infrastructure and Movie Catalogue — so there is
something to look at the moment it prints the URLs.

Before recording, cache the images so a slow pull can't stall a take:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose build
```

Then:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Elastiflix | http://localhost:3000 |
| Kibana | http://localhost:5601 |
| Elasticsearch | http://localhost:9200 |
| Logstash monitoring API | http://localhost:9600 |

Watch the catalog land:

```bash
curl -s localhost:9200/elastiflix-movies/_count
# -> {"count":6959,...}
```

Tear it all down with `./uninstall.sh`.

## What this fork changes

Configs live in `elk/`; the compose file and the three scripts sit at the repo root. Diff this
branch against `upstream/main` to see exactly what changed.

### 1. Structured logging in the backend — `backend/src/logger.js`

Upstream logged `console.info("Search request:", state, queryConfig)`: a multi-line JS object
dump with no HTTP method, no status code and no latency. Nothing a log pipeline can aggregate.

This fork emits one JSON object per line:

```json
{"@timestamp":"2026-08-18T09:14:02.881Z","level":"info","service":"elastiflix-backend",
 "method":"POST","path":"/api/search","status":200,"duration_ms":42,
 "search_type":"lexical","query":"matrix","results":12,"page":1}
```

That `query` field is what powers the "top search terms" panel in Kibana. It also adds `try/catch`
to the search handlers — upstream had none, so an Elasticsearch error became an unhandled
rejection and the browser just hung.

Zero new npm dependencies.

### 2. Logstash replaces the Python loader — `elk/logstash/pipeline/movies.conf`

Same `movies.json.gz`, same target index, but declarative. The pipeline does three things a
plain bulk load doesn't:

- **Type coercion** — `id` is an integer in the source but a `keyword` in the mapping
- **Enrichment** — the UI renders a `user_score` facet, but *not one of the 6,959 source
  documents contains that field*, so upstream's facet is permanently empty. We derive it from
  `vote_average` (same 0–10 scale) and the facet works
- **Quality gates** — drops untitled records, handles empty dates

Compare it with `data-loader/index-data.py` side by side. That contrast is the argument for
Logstash.

### 3. Beats — `elk/beats/`

- `filebeat.yml` — autodiscovers the Elastiflix containers and ships their stdout to **Logstash**
  (not straight to ES), so the full `Beats → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana` path is visible
- `metricbeat.yml` — Docker + Elasticsearch modules, shipping **direct to Elasticsearch**,
  because there's nothing to transform. Logstash is a choice, not a mandatory tax

Metricbeat also loads its prebuilt dashboards into Kibana automatically — about 112 of them.

**Be aware:** that load *blocks metric publishing* while it runs, 3–5 minutes on a first start.
`metricbeat-*` sitting at zero documents for the first few minutes is expected, not a failure.
Start the stack before you need it.

### 4. Upstream bugs fixed

| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| `pip-requirements.txt` pinned `elasticsearch==8.4.0`, far too old for the `inference.put` / `semantic_text` APIs the loader calls | Bumped to `9.1.0`, added the undeclared `tqdm`. **This makes it install, not work** — see below |
| `docker-compose.yml` set `ES_INDEX=elastiflix-movies` but `index-data.py` defaulted to `movies`, so following the README gave `index_not_found` | Default changed to `elastiflix-movies` |
| `parallel_bulk(chunk_size=10)` — needlessly slow | Raised to 500 |
| Compose pointed at a placeholder Elastic Cloud URL requiring a hand-pasted API key | Points at local Elasticsearch, no credentials needed |

---

## Why not Elastic's `start-local`?

Elastic's docs point at a one-liner (`curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh`), and it's
worth knowing. It starts **Elasticsearch and Kibana only** — no Logstash, no Beats. Since three
of the four components this project teaches aren't in it, we'd need a compose file anyway, and
running both means two networks plus wiring its generated API key into three configs.

The single root `docker-compose.yml` starts all seven together instead. See `LEARN.md` §11
for what `start-local` does, when to prefer it, and how to try it.

## Running on an AWS EC2 instance

Works the same way, with a few things to get right first:

- **Instance size**: `t3.large` (8 GB) minimum, `t3.xlarge` (16 GB) comfortable — same
  memory bar as running this on a laptop.
- **Storage**: 30 GB+ EBS volume (container images + Elasticsearch data + logs add up).
- **Security group**: open inbound ports `3000` (Elastiflix), `5601` (Kibana), `9200`
  (Elasticsearch) and `17700` (backend) to your IP.
- **Docker**: install it if the AMI doesn't have it — `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh`.
- **`vm.max_map_count`**: Elasticsearch needs this raised on native Linux (Docker Desktop
  on Mac/Windows sets it for you inside its own VM, so this is easy to miss):
  ```bash
  sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
  ```
- **`PUBLIC_HOST`**: the frontend's `REACT_APP_ES_API` URL is baked into the JS bundle
  at build time, so it must point at a host your browser can actually reach — not
  `localhost`, which on EC2 means your own laptop. Set it to the instance's public
  IP/DNS before starting:
  ```bash
  export PUBLIC_HOST=<ec2-public-ip-or-dns>
  ./start.sh
  ```

Then open `http://<PUBLIC_HOST>:3000` and `http://<PUBLIC_HOST>:5601` from your browser.

## A note on security

`xpack.security.enabled=false` in `docker-compose.yml`. That is deliberate: this is a
local teaching demo and it removes passwords, TLS certificates and API keys as things that can
break mid-lesson. **Never run a real cluster this way.**

## Semantic search / ELSER

Upstream Elastiflix also demos ELSER semantic search and hybrid retrieval. That's deliberately
**not** covered here — it needs an ML node and a trial licence, and the model download makes it
fragile. The `plot_elser` / `plot_e5` fields are stripped from the index template in this fork.
The `/api/semantic/search` and `/api/hybrid/search` routes still exist and will error without
those inference endpoints.
